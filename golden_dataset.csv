how to fine-tune LLM,"Large Language Models (LLMs) have — thanks to transformers and enormous training data — versatile functionalities with remarkable performance. Usually, LLMs are general-purpose and aren’t trained with a solitary purpose in mind. For example, GPT-4 can allow language translation, text generation, question answering, and many other features.

For specific applications, say having a chatbot for healthcare or language translation for an underrepresented language, we need to have a specialized model. Luckily, one of the powerful features of LLMs (and other transformer-based models) is their ability to adapt. Hence, instead of training the model from scratch, we can take the existing LLM model and fine-tune it on the training data.

Fine-tuning is crucial in the domain of Large Language Models (LLMs), and there are many methods for it. As a result, we will be dedicating a couple of blogs to delve into the topic of fine-tuning and also compare it with other methods, such as prompt engineering and RAG. In our initial blog, we will explore the process of fine-tuning using the Hugging Face transformers library, while the subsequent one will focus on using OpenAI to fine-tune a general-purpose model.

LLMs Fine-tuning
Fine-tuning can be either full or partial. Due to the huge size of the LLMs, it’s infeasible to fine-tune them in full, and hence Performance Efficient fine-tuning (commonly known as PEFT) is a common technique for fine-tuning the LLMs. Since PEFT has good support in Hugging Face, so we will use the Hugging Face model for the purpose.

Load the Pre-trained Model
Hugging Face has a whole ecosystem of libraries, so there are some useful libraries/modules, like:

Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT)
Performance Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT)
AutoTokenizer
For the pre-trained model, we can use any open-source model. And here, we will use Falcon-7b for its smaller size and amazing performance. Prepare the Dataset
SFT (which we are going to use shortly in a while for the training) allows the Hugging Face hub datasets to be directly used. We can take leverage of heaps of datasets available there. Like, we will use the Open Assistance dataset for prompting.

Note: In case the dataset you want to use for fine-tuning is unavailable on the Hugging Face hub, you can upload it using your account. Modify the Model According to the Requirements
In addition to partial fine-tuning, we can also use quantization to further reduce the weights’ size: Real-world Applications of LLMs Fine-tuning
Fine-tuning is changing how industries use AI, making it more affordable and user-friendly. Unlike using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which requires continuous cost, fine-tuning lets you customize an open-source model once without further expenses. This gives you complete control and eliminates the need for extra infrastructure. Examples like PaLM and FinGPT show how fine-tuned models can be powerful and flexible:

Customer Service Automation: By fine-tuning models for specific customer service businesses, developers can create chatbots that don’t just mimic general conversation but understand and respond to queries in the context of their business. This approach avoids the use of external resources and provides 24/7 customer support that truly understands the terminologies and customer questions, improving the overall customer experience and satisfaction.
Language Translation Services: Through fine-tuning, developers can improve the language models to specialize in language translation tasks, bypassing the generic one-size-fits-all approach. This helps break down language barriers more effectively in international business and travel, without the need for the continuous cost of external APIs.
Personalized Education: Fine-tuning makes it possible to create AI-powered platforms that adjust the learning materials to fit the speed and learning style of each student. By owning the model, educational institutions can continuously evolve and adapt the learning material without additional costs, making education more personalized and impactful.
These examples show that fine-tuning LLMs can be applied to solve real-world problems and enhance everyday life. The adaptability and efficiency of fine-tuned models promise even more innovative applications in the future.

Conclusion
The capabilities of LLMs can be utilized by fine-tuning them for some specific task using a specialized dataset. It has been made easier with libraries like Hugging Face and PEFT techniques like partial fine-tuning and quantization. Due to the massive outbreak of open-source LLMs like Llama, Vicuana, Falcon, Aya and many others, LLM fine-tuning is becoming easier and affordable.

Nowadays, many organizations are developing AI applications using the APIs of Large Language Models (LLMs), where vector databases play a significant role by offering efficient storage and retrieval of contextual embeddings. MyScale is a vector database that has been designed specifically for AI applications, keeping all the factors in mind such as cost, accuracy, and speed. It is very easy to digest for the developers because it only requires SQL to interact with.

Fine-tuning plays a pivotal role in optimizing Large Language Models (LLMs), offering diverse methodologies for this endeavor. Stay tuned for our upcoming blog, where we’ll explore fine-tuning a general-purpose model with OpenAI.",How to Fine-Tune an LLM from Hugging Face
data visualisation python,"Which Visualisation library do you use most in Python and what other options are there?

When using Python you’re spoilt with choice, or as I say blessed with options!

When you’re starting you’ll probably use Matplotlib but over time you’ll appreciate some of the other excellent libraries like Seaborn, Altair or Plotly.

For some, it’ll be a matter of functionality and ease of coding.

For others, it’ll be the visualisation capabilities, the graphics/rendering or the interactive features.

It all depends on the problem you’re solving and the data structure you’re using.

Here’s a list of the most popular visualisation libraries with some top features:

Matplotlib The first data visualisation Library created in Python, designed and inspired by Matlab. Lots of other libraries are build on top of it. Works well with arrays by default. Using dataframes or matrices might not always work off the box and might need some tweaking. Generally used for static graphs like plots, bar charts, histograms, scatterplots, pie charts etc…Think of it as the Swiss Army knife for plotting!

Seaborn

Although it’s a standalone library, it’s a wrapper library based on Matplotlib. You can use less code to harness the power of Matplotlib, but also create more aesthetically pleasing graphs. Works well with arrays and dataframes.

Ggplot

I’m probably entering heretic territory here (@david langer) but there is an alternative to the mighty ggplot2 for R :) .As a result, it’s been ported from ggplot2. It is based on Grammar of Graphics (reference book for vis data) and works well with Pandas Dataframes.

Bokeh

Another great vis library that creates interactive graphs with focus, much like Seaborn, on plotting quality and generally nice looking, elegant graphs, with the additional feature to use web browsers for presentation. Very effective over large datasets or streaming and designed to support a range of interactive graphs from simple plots to data applications.

Altair

This library is used for declarative visualisations (you only need to declare links between data columns to the encoding channels, such as x-axis, y-axis, colour, etc. and rest all of the plot details are handled automatically — in Matplotlib you’d need to specify all these) . It is based on Vega and Vega light visualisation grammar (similar to the Grammar of Graphics) and can produce beautiful and elegant graphics focusing on simplicity for understanding your data better with minimal amount of code. Works well with Pandas Dataframes.

Plotly

A sophisticated library that allows you to create elegant and interactive plot and graphs. On top of all the standard features that you’ll find with other libraries, it offers Plotly Express as a quick way to get around with plotting and Chart Studio which allows you to edit plots online. Also, allows you to create unique graphs like contour plots or dendrograms.

data visualisation python,"In this article, we will examine some of the colour schemes of Python, mainly Seaborn library. This will be in the Python Notebook format which includes codes next to graphs.

Let’s start with the necessary imports:

We will use one of the datasets of Seaborn library, called “tips”. Summary of the dataset is as follows:

244 restaurant order transactions (rows)
7 features (columns):
Total Bill (USD)
2. Tip (USD)

3. Sex (Female/Male)

4. Smoker (Yes/No)

5. Day (Sat, Sun, Thur, Fri)

6. Time (Lunch, Dinner)

7. Size (ranging from 1 to 6)

Use default style/palette
Let’s now visualise tips by day in seaborn barplot with the default colour scheme (matplotlib)

Change figure styles
Five number of styles are available, my personal favorite style is “darkgrid”. You can use “set_style” or “set” to changing the style of figures for the rest of the notebook.

Syntax:

sns.set_style(“darkgrid”)

Say you want to use different styles in different parts of the notebook. You set the style temporarily by using the “with” statement which applies the style only to the plots under it.

Syntax: with sns.axes_style(“darkgrid”):


or

sns.set(style=”darkgrid”)

what is nlp,"Natural Language Processing, commonly abbreviated as NLP, is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. The ultimate objective of NLP is to enable computers to understand, interpret, and respond to human language in a valuable and meaningful way.

The Mechanics of NLP
NLP combines computational linguistics — rule-based modeling of human language — with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. These technologies enable computers to process human language in the form of text or voice data and to ‘understand’ its full meaning, complete with the speaker or writer’s intent and sentiment.

Key Components of NLP
Syntax and Semantics Analysis: Syntax refers to the arrangement of words in a sentence to make grammatical sense. NLP uses syntax to assess how words are organized, focusing on grammatical structures. Semantics, on the other hand, is about the meaning conveyed by a text. NLP attempts to understand the actual meaning of words or sentences in context.
Entity Recognition: This involves identifying key elements in a text, like names of people, places, brands, or dates.
Contextual Analysis: Understanding the context in which words or phrases are used. This is crucial for languages where the same word can have different meanings based on its context.
Applications of NLP
Chatbots and Virtual Assistants: Siri, Alexa, and other smart assistants use NLP to understand and respond to voice commands.
Translation Services: Tools like Google Translate apply NLP to translate text or speech from one language to another.
Sentiment Analysis: Used by businesses to gauge public sentiment about their products or services through social media monitoring.
Email Filters: Email services use NLP to classify emails into spam, social, and primary categories.
Challenges in NLP
NLP is not without its challenges. The complexity of human language, including idioms, slang, and regional dialects, makes language processing a difficult task for computers. Additionally, languages are constantly evolving, requiring ongoing adjustments in NLP systems.

Recent Advances in NLP
The field of NLP has seen remarkable growth with the advent of machine learning and deep learning. Innovations like OpenAI’s GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models have revolutionized the way computers understand and generate human language.

The Future of NLP
As technology advances, NLP is expected to become more sophisticated, with enhanced ability to understand and interpret the nuances of human language. This will lead to more intelligent and intuitive human-computer interactions.

The Impact of NLP on Society
NLP technology has a significant impact on how we interact with machines and how businesses understand their customers. As NLP continues to evolve, it promises to make our interactions with technology smoother and more natural, mimicking human conversation.

Difference between NLP (Natural Language Processing) and LLM (Large Language Models)
NLP: refers to the entire field of computer science concerned with interactions between computers and human language. It includes various techniques and approaches for enabling computers to understand, manipulate, and generate human languages. LLMs are a specific type of NLP model.
LLM (Large Language Model): This is a type of NLP model that’s been trained on massive amounts of text data. This allows them to handle a broad range of NLP tasks, including generating text, translating languages, writing different kinds of creative content, and answering your questions in an informative way.
NLP models may be multimodal (meaning that they can use other modes of inputs and generate output other than text), by still using underlying NLP text as an interface.

Examples of non-NLP (Natural Language Processing) AI Models
AI is a broad term and can be used in a variety of applications that are not related to Natural Language Processing.

Here are 5 examples of AI models that do not use NLP (Natural Language Processing)

Image/Object Recognition Systems: These models are trained on vast datasets of labeled images to recognize objects, faces, or scenes within an image. They function by identifying patterns and relationships between pixels, not by understanding the text descriptions of the images.
Self-Driving Car Autopilots: These systems utilize computer vision, sensor fusion (combining data from cameras, radar, LiDAR), and path planning algorithms to navigate roads. They don’t require understanding language for operation.
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Image Generation: This type of AI model involves two neural networks competing with each other. One network (generator) creates new images, while the other (discriminator) tries to distinguish real images from the generated ones. This process leads to the generation of increasingly realistic and creative images without any language input.
AlphaGo Zero (Go Playing): This is a deep reinforcement learning model developed by DeepMind. It achieved superhuman performance in the complex game of Go without any human knowledge or pre-programmed moves. It learned solely through playing against itself and millions of simulated games.
Anomaly Detection Systems (Finance): These AI models analyze financial data to identify unusual patterns that might indicate fraud or market fluctuations. They rely on statistical methods and pattern recognition techniques, not language processing.
Types of NLP Models
At a very high level NLP Models can be broadly categorized into the following three types.

Statistical Models
Rule Based Models
Neural Network Based Models (including LLMs) — Learning networks
